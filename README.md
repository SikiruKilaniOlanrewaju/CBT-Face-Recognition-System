# Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) in the Authentication System of the Computer Based Test

This project is a Python-based authentication system using facial recognition for computer-based tests. It leverages OpenCV and face recognition libraries. The project is structured for easy extension and integration.

## Features
- User authentication via facial recognition
- Modular codebase for future enhancements
- Simple interface (CLI or GUI)

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install opencv-python face_recognition
   ```
4. Run the main application (to be implemented):
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — Entry point for the application
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — Copilot custom instructions

## Notes
- Replace placeholder code and assets as needed.
- For GUI, consider using Tkinter or Flask.
